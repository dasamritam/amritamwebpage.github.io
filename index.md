I am an assistant professor at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I am part of the Control Systems [(CS)](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/control-systems/) group at the Eletrical Enegineering (EE) department. Previously, I held post-doctoral fellowship at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden and the University of Cambridge, UK. I recieved MSc. in Systems & Control and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2016 and 2020, respectively.

I am originally from India. Outside work I am passionate about [effective altruism](https://effectiefaltruisme.nl/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw4f6zBhBVEiwATEHFVuyga0xkV3e5QDUmm31n40HGQYFgTJIH5hrlGko7Ovm4II3Hw4SdtRoCiRsQAvD_BwE), backgammon and cooking.

My Expertise
======
Area of my expertise is [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and its application. What excites me most about control theory is that despite of being a part of applied mathematics, control theory is always inspired by a concrete, real-world application. In control theory, I specialize in [Control of PDEs](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Control_of_partial_differential_equations), [Physics Informed Leanring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks), [Passivity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivity_(engineering)), and [Model Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction).

Core Theme of Research
======
My research focuses on *designing controllers for complex multi-physical systems*. I complement new theories with applications of societal and industrial importance. There are two kinds of applications that I work on; as shown in the thematic depiction of my research below:
