I am an assistant professor at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). I am part of the Control Systems (CS) group at the Eletrical Enegineering (EE) department. Previously, I held post-doctoral fellowship at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden and the University of Cambridge, UK. I recieved MSc. in Systems & Control and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2016 and 2020, respectively.

### My Research

Area of my expertise is **control theory** and its application. What excites me most about control theory is that despite of being a part of applied mathematics, control theory is always inspired by a concrete, real-world application. In control theory, I specialize in Control of PDEs, Physics Informed Leanring, Passivity theory, and Model Reduction.

My research focuses on *designing controllers for complex multi-physical systems*. I complement new theories with applications of societal and industrial importance. There are two kinds of applications that I work on; as shown in the thematic depiction of my research below:
