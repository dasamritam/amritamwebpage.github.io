I received a B.Sc. degree in Information Engineering in 2013 and a M.Sc. degree (with honor) in Automation Engineering in 2016, from the University of Padova, Italy. From August 2016 until November 2021, I was a Ph.D. student at the [Division of Automatic Control](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/isy/rt), Department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University. My main supervisor was [Prof. Claudio Altafini](https://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/claal20/). In September 2021 I successfully defended my Ph.D.  dissertation, titled "Collective decision-making on networked systems in presence of antagonistic interactions". From 2021 to 2024, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at the [Division of Decision and Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/is/dcs), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), KTH Royal Institute of Technology, working with [Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/).

My research interests are in the area of networked systems and nonlinear dynamics over networks, with applications to social networks and collective decision-making processes; Signed networks theory; Cyber-physical-human systems (CPHS) and the interactions between cyber-physical systems and humans in the context of smart cities, with applications to Live-in Laboratories.
