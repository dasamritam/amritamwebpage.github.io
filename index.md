I received a B.Sc. degree in Information Engineering in 2013 and a M.Sc. degree (with honor) in Automation Engineering in 2016, from the University of Padova, Italy. From August 2016 until November 2021, I was a Ph.D. student at the Division of Automatic Control, Department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University. My main supervisor was [Prof. Claudio Altafini](https://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/claal20/). In September 2021 I successfully defended my Ph.D.  dissertation, entitled "Collective decision-making on networked systems in presence of antagonistic interactions"

Since December 2021, I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Division of Decision and Control Systems (EECS) of KTH Royal Institute of Technology under the main supervision of [Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/).

My research interests are in the area of networked systems and nonlinear dynamics over networks, with applications to social networks and collective decision-making processes.
