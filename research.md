My research seeks answer to the following question: _How can we use physics and data together to maximise the long-term efficiency and reliability of engineering systems as they gradually change over time and across different locations?_

- In multi-physical systems, more than one phase of matter interact with each other and simultaneously obey physical laws from different disciplines of physics and chemistry. Many physical quantities may vary over time as well as space.

- Controlling such a system is _very hard_ without making some prior approximations. However, approximation deteriorates model quality, hence, the performance of a model-based controller. A key focus of my research is to rectify this issue.

- Compared to typical engineering systems, _brain-inspired_ devices, such as neuromorphic chips, are quite different. Instead of 1s and 0s, they communicate via spikes. Conventional control theory is unsuitable for such a device since generating spikes requires two feedback-control loops of opposite signs. My research provides methods and tools to design such control systems for modulating spikes over space and time.

My current research broadly encompasses the following themes.
