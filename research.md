My research seeks answer to the following question: **How can we combine known invariants with real-world data to guarantee the best performance of physical systems?** My focus is on dynamical systems where behaviors emerge from vast networks of interacting objects spread across different locations. These behaviors are driven by partial integro-differential equations equations that are tough to solve, and observing them is often limited by budget constraints on sensors and their placements.

To tackle these challenges, I develop powerful computational tools grounded on optimization, control theory, and machine learning.
